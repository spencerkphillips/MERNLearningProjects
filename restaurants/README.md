## Project #1 | Restaurants & Reviews
This project is a simple yet powerful project created by the wonderful people over at [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org) and updated by me. You can checkout the full in-depth tutorial over at their [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrHNSanmqQ4)

### Backend
So, what does this app do? Well, its an API driven restaurant review app that polls a set of Collections from MongoDB, in this case MongoDB Atlas and outputs that data in the form of JSON. That's what we have running on the backend with Node.js/Express.

### Frontend
The frontend of this app can be built with **ANYTHING** bit it's MERN so, it will obviously use React, now you could also do the same app but with Angular if you really wanted to use the MEAN stack, its just up to personal preference.

### The Changes
Outside of just general terminalogy and casing, I have/will be adding some more features to make this a nice case study. So here they are:

- GET method on the /reviews route
- Fully functional user authentication with OAuth
- Admin review moderation (for spam)
- Comment system, so you can have a conversation with the reviewer and learn more

With these extra features, this small app can be a very powerful case-study to show a perspective client or employer and it's just great to learn from as well.
